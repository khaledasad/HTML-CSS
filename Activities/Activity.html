<h3>About GGC</h3>

<h4>Welcome to the future of education. Your education.</h4>  

<p>A few years ago, <b>Georgia Gwinnett College</b> was home to just over 100 students. Let’s just say – things have changed. What was once <mark>260 acres</mark> of rolling terrain has become the perfect metropolitan college campus, approaching 11,000 students. What’s so perfect about it? GGC adapts to how you do things – your learning style, your work schedule and your life. From the ground up, GGC was designed to help you succeed.</p>

<h3>Founded</h3>

<p>In 1994, <i>Gwinnett County</i> was the largest county east of the Mississippi without a four-year college. So Gwinnett County leaders purchased 160 acres of land and designated it specifically for the development of a college campus. GGC opened its doors in 2006 as the first four-year college founded in Georgia in more than 100 years, and the first four-year, public college created in the U.S. in the 21st century. Georgia Gwinnett College is a member of the <b><i>University System of Georgia.</b></i></p>
